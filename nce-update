-------------
differences from nspcloud

do not use openstack
a baremetal machine from equinix is used to host all VMs for NSP cluster, NFMP and vsims
offcial installation procedure is used rather than openstack template
a combination of python, ansible and bash scripts are used for automation
after installation of NSP, NFMP, vsims,
-- nfmp discovery rules, mediation policies
-- oss_user, groups policies
-- stats policies (performance and accounting)
-- mdm discovery rules and oam policies
-- telmetery subscriptions

challenges
-- for every new release we need to accomodate the changes in installation procedures
-- need to accomodate the changes in the post insallation configuration steps
-- uploading the files takes long time to the file server
-- we can start automation testing only when the Candidate load is available
-- license management is challeng, as we use trial licenses and needs to  update them every 90 days
-- NE upgrade
-- supporting and maintain of the older release
